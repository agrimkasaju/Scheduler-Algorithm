...

The condition that leads to deadlock/livelock is when a TA acquires the semaphores and is not able to imediately release them after. It runs into a deadlock issue where the current TA 
is waiting for the resources of the previous TA to release it's semaphores but is unable to do so when a TA is finished its round. As you can see in the above example when TA 5 acquires
the semaphores and is unable to release them livelock occurs when TA 1 attempts to acquire the semaphores and keeps on progressing until it finishes its round and since it can't realse it's semaphores
it's stops progressing and reaches deadlock.

All TAs have finished marking exams.

The solution is deadlock/livelock free as semaphores are imediately realeased before the TA's can start marking and before the TA's complete a round. As you can see in the above example that
once TA 1 acquires the semaphores, it imediately realeases them before TA 1 has completed a round. In this case resources are not lock once a round has been completed and every TA progresses
if they acquire semaphores j and j + 1.
