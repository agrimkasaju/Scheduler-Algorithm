All TAs have finished marking exams.

The solution is deadlock/livelock free as semaphores are imediately realeased before the TA's can start marking and before the TA's complete a round. As you can see in the above example that
once TA 1 acquires the semaphores, it imediately realeases them before TA 1 has completed a round. In this case resources are not lock once a round has been completed and every TA progresses
if they acquire semaphores j and j + 1.
