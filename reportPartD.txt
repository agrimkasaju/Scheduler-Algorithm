The condition that leads to deadlock/livelock is when a TA acquires the semaphores and is not able to imediately release them after. It runs into a deadlock issue where the current TA 
is waiting for the resources of the previous TA to release it's semaphores but is unable to do so when a TA is finished its round. As you can see in the above example when TA 5 acquires
the semaphores and is unable to release them livelock occurs when TA 1 attempts to acquire the semaphores and keeps on progressing until it finishes its round and since it can't realse it's semaphores
it's stops progressing and reaches deadlock.
